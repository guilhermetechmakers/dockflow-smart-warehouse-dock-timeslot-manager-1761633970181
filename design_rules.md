# Design Rules for This Project

## Project Design Pattern: ---

## Visual Style

### Color Palette:
- Primary: Bright Coral Red (#FF4C4C) for highlights, buttons, graphs, and key accents.
- Secondary: Medium Gray (#F6F6F8) for backgrounds and card surfaces, providing gentle separation.
- Accent: Light Gray (#E9EAED) for borders, card backgrounds, and section dividers.
- Black/Gray: Dark Gray (#222222) for headings and primary text; Medium Gray (#888888) for secondary text.
- White (#FFFFFF) as the dominant background, ensuring clarity and contrast.
- Relationships: Red is reserved for actionable and high-attention elements (buttons, metrics, active states), while the neutral grays and white maintain a clean, open feel.

### Typography & Layout:
- Font Family: Modern sans-serif, resembling Inter or SF Pro, with smooth, readable glyphs.
- Weights: Regular for body (400), Medium for secondary emphasis (500), Bold for primary headings (700).
- Hierarchy: Large headline for key metrics/titles, clear subheadings, smaller body text; numerical data is bold and prominent.
- Spacing: Generous padding around cards and modules; consistent 16–24px gaps between elements.
- Alignment: Left-aligned for text, center-aligned for key metrics; content anchored to a tight grid for modularity.
- Typography Treatments: Uppercase for section labels, subtle gray for muted and secondary text, red for emphasis.

### Key Design Elements
#### Card Design:
- Cards: Rounded corners (16px radius), soft drop shadows (very subtle, #00000012), borderless or with faint light-gray outlines.
- Hover: Slight shadow intensification and background brightness increase.
- Hierarchy: Titles and metrics at the top, supporting details below, action buttons anchored bottom-right.

#### Navigation:
- Sidebar: Vertical, anchored left, with pill-shaped active state filled in coral red; minimalist icons and labels.
- Active State: Bold red background with white text/icon; inactive items use gray text/icons.
- Collapsible Sections: Indicated by subtle arrows or section breaks.

#### Data Visualization:
- Charts: Simple line graphs with bold coral-red lines, minimal gridlines, and dots for data points.
- Progress Bars: Large, animated fill with red accent; overlaying metrics for clarity.
- Patterns: Stat cards, inline mini-charts, and large numeric KPIs.

#### Interactive Elements:
- Buttons: Rounded, pill-shaped, filled coral red with white text; outlined variants for secondary actions.
- Forms: Rounded input fields, light gray backgrounds, clear focus ring (light red).
- Hover Effects: Slightly brighter fill for buttons, subtle elevation on cards, underline for clickable links.
- Micro-interactions: Numeric counters animate on change, chart lines animate smoothly.

### Design Philosophy
This interface embodies:
- A modern, minimalist, and highly professional SaaS aesthetic.
- Clarity through whitespace, concise visual hierarchy, and color-coded accents for actionable elements.
- User-centric design: frictionless navigation, modular cards, and immediate visibility of key operational metrics.
- Visual strategy centers on approachability and control: every interaction is obvious, every metric stands out, and the interface feels clean, trustworthy, and dynamic—well-suited for logistics professionals needing fast, reliable, and actionable insights.

## General Design Principles

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Dark mode with elevated surfaces

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Test colors in both light and dark modes

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)
- Adjust shadow intensity based on theme (lighter in dark mode)

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

---

## Consistency Rules

### Maintain Consistency
**What should stay consistent:**
- Spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions
- Hero section design
- Card styling variations
- Background patterns or textures

---

---

## Technical Excellence

### Performance
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Code splitting for faster loads
- Debounce search inputs
- Virtualize long lists
- Minimize re-renders
- Use proper memoization

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- ARIA labels where needed
- Focus indicators visible
- Screen reader friendly
- Sufficient color contrast (both themes)
- Respect reduced motion preferences

## Key Principles

1. **Be Bold** - Don't be afraid to try unique layouts and interactions
2. **Be Consistent** - Use the same patterns for similar functions
3. **Be Responsive** - Design works beautifully on all devices
4. **Be Fast** - Animations are smooth, loading is quick
5. **Be Accessible** - Everyone can use what you build
6. **Be Modern** - Use current design trends and technologies
7. **Be Unique** - Each project should have its own personality
8. **Be Intuitive** - Users shouldn't need instructions
9. **Be Themeable** - Support both dark and light modes seamlessly
